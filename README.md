# Computational Physics (PHYS-25000) Final
### 
This was my final project for my computational physics class. I was looking to analyze the increase of home runs hit in Coors field in Colorado.
Using the Runga-Kutta 4 method, I approximated the trajectory of a baseball including lift and drag forces with air density as a variable.
I then used hitting data acquired from Baseball Savant and usng initial velocities and based on backspin data from 538, estimated how far the baseballs would have gone, and whether or not they would have qualified for a home run.
I compared the increased number of homeruns in three batters in comparison to the league difference in HR's hit in Colorado.
